1.. Firebase Realtime Database can accept HTTP requests directly using its REST API.
    STEPS:-
        1. A Firebase project with a Realtime Database set up
        2. Your databaseâ€™s URL

    An optional authentication key (if not in public read/write mode)


2. Create a Firebase Project
    STEPS:-
        1. Click "Add Project", give it a name, and follow the prompts.
        2. In the left sidebar, go to Build --> Realtime Database.
        3. Click Create Database.
        4. Choose location and start in Test mode (no auth required - for development).


3. Operations
    POST --> Creates a new child with a unique key every time.
    PUT --> Replaces data at the given path.
    PATCH --> Updates only the given fields without replacing everything.
    GET --> Reads data from Firebase.


8. Security Notes
    In Test mode, anyone can read/write from database. Use it only for development.
    For production, switch to locked mode and use Firebase Authentication with an auth token in HTTP requests.
